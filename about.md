Hey, I'm Dominik!

I'm driven to push the frontier of machine intelligence. I studied Economics at University College London and now build AI solutions to directly enable our economy and society ðŸ™‚

Here are some projects I was involved with:


[Cognigy](https://www.cognigy.com) is a leading enterprise contact center and conversational AI platform.

[Gyana](https://www.gyana.com) was a self-service data science platform for AI data-driven insights.

[Real Impact Analytics (now Riaktr)](https://www.riaktr.com) makes people-centric data applications driving concrete impact and actions, allowing users to work more easily, smarter and more effectively.

[Scientory](https://www.scientory.com) was a academic publishing platform project to unbreak academia to bring back the focus on a community of peers of deep knowledge, integrity and expertise.
